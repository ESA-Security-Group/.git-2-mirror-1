Upon such grant of rights to Us, We immediately grant to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:

### 3. Disclaimer
The contribution is provided "as is". ore particularly, all express or implied warranties including, without limitation, any implied warranty of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement are expressly disclaimed by you to us and by us to you. To the extent that any such warranties cannot be disclaimed, such warranty is limited in duration and extent to the minimum period and extent permitted by law.

### 4. Consequential damage waiver
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will you or we be liable for any loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of data, indirect, special, incidental, consequential and exemplary damages arising out of this agreement regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based.

### 5. Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver
If the disclaimer and damage waiver mentioned in section 3 and section 4 cannot be given legal effect under applicable local law, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil or contractual liability in connection with the contribution.

### 6. Term
6.1 This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions.

6.2 In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, (sub)licenses that have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.

### 7. Miscellaneous

7.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.

7.3 In case of Your death, this agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly authorized person.

7.4 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

7.5 You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.
